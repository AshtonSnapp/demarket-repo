# Demarket Repo

Demarket (or, if you're a startup or hipster, "dmarqet") is an idea I've had for a while - a protocol or API for creating a decentralized app store. Although, now, the scope has been expanded to allow for other kinds of media - video, audio, and eBooks - so to keep things simple I'll refer to everything as "assets".

This project is currently in its early stages. Many things are still undetermined.
